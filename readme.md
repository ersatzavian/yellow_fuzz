# Yellow Fuzz

A bass fuzz for my good friend! Don't tell him, it's a surprise. Starting with a Boss MT-2 (I know, ew, don't tell anybody) because that's allegedly how Arion Salazar got most of his fuzz tone's on Third Eye Blind's self-titled (check out 2:20-2:30 in Graduate, of 4:10 in Thanks a Lot if you like yours with phaser). Hell yeah we want that, don't pretend you don't like that record. 

Adding the popular mods as options, retuning most of the gyrator filters down a bit, adding trim pots for some of the key filters and gains, and doing a non-form-factor layout so I can get all my dumb bugs out of my system before it's annoying to rework.

Form factor by May lol!

## Mods Planned

| Change | Goal | Done |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| Change filters in bypass connection. | Prevent bass cut in bypass; tuned at ~200 Hz in MT-2. Find a good FET-switched pedal to reference. |  |
| Make gyrators after clipping stage optional (see C24/C25, C20/C17) | Experiment with pedal character to reduce fizz and deliver more even tone to the eq section so I can hear the difference. |  |
| Add bypass option for preboost stage. | Try to reduce fizz. | |
| Add series variable resistors (trim pots) to clipping diodes D3/D4. | Try to reduce fizz. |  |
| Add trim pot to tune center frequency of preboost filter. Trim R53 from 20k to 220k, chnage C34 from 27n to 68n. | Retune for bass. |  |
| Retune dual bandpass filter after distortion stage. Low peak 50 - 150 Hz, High peak 1k - 3k, both with bypasses. | Retune for bass. | |
